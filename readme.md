[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/manuelitox/mini.scss.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/manuelitox/mini.scss)

Allows us start to write Sass code quick and easily. It's simple, Mini.scss is a basic structure, nothing else.

### Install:

#### You can find the documentation in the <code>sassdoc/index.html</code> file.

### FYI:

* Deleted the grid system. Instead, I recommend use [Susy - Responsive layout toolkit for Sass ](https://github.com/oddbird/susy). You can install it by npm: `$ npm install susy --save-dev`
